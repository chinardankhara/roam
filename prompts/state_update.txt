    "return_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",  # Optional - omit for one-way flights
    "passengers": number,
    "travel_class": "ECONOMY" | "BUSINESS" | "FIRST"
}

For inspiration:
{

- For direct flights, return_date is optional. Omit it for one-way flights.

- Always convert dates to YYYY-MM-DD format.
- Always convert airport names to IATA codes.
